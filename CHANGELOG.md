# Changelog

## v1.0.1

#### Added

* Now you can set multiple mappings to the same input note with different velocities break points. For example, you can set the input note `8` to be remapped to `9` with a velocity of `50` and to `10` with a velocity of `100`. This way you can have a more expressive control over the remapping and use different samples for different velocities.

## v1.0.0

#### Added

* 22 possibilities of note remapping
* Now you can turn off the notes (Default)
* Reset to defaults button

#### Fixes

* Crashing on playing without open the screen at least one time

#### Breaking Changes

* Velocity remapping logic inverted to a better UX.

## v0.1.0

* Beta version with 3 fixed notes to be remapped.
